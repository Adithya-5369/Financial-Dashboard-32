## 🚀 Overview

This frontend-only Financial Portfolio Dashboard was built as a hackathon project in response to the challenge:
> *“Build a financial portfolio dashboard with stock performance charts.”*

This frontend-only application provides a comprehensive and real-time overview of a user’s investment portfolio. It’s designed with a modern UI and intuitive UX to help users visualize, analyze, and explore their stock performance.
